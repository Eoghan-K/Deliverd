# Notes
## 09/02/2018
- Connected to Bitnami Parse Server using EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) of AWS (Amazon Web Service).
- This will basically let us do a whole bunch of stuff on the cloud such as sending push notifications to all drivers when a request is made.
- At the moment as the app opens it just sends some data to the server as a test.
- We can login and monitor the server activity <a href="ec2-34-244-162-243.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
- The username is 'user'.
- The password is '3DPcDHLZ57Hh'.
